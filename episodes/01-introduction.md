::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Statistics involves collection, analysis, interpretation, and communication of
data. 

Experimental design aims to describe and explain variation in natural systems by
intervening to affect that variation directly. 

 For example, the Salk polio vaccine trials
collected data about variation in polio incidence after injecting hundreds of 
thousands of schoolchildren with vaccine or placebo (or by observing more than a
million unvaccinated children for polio incidence and comparing this incidence
to that of the treatment group). This controlled trial hypothesized that the
vaccine would reduce the incidence of polio in schoolchildren.

Naturalistic studies gather data with minimal intervention, 
In observational studies,
