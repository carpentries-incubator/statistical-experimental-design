::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Good experimental design generates information-rich data with a clear message. 
In both scientific research and industry, experimental design plays a critical 
role in obtaining reliable and meaningful results. Scientists can better 
understand their work when they carry out well-conceived, well-executed 
experiments and then extract, communicate, and act on information generated in 
those experiments. This course will prepare scientists to design rigorous 
experiments that generate high-value data and to extract and communicate its 
messages. By applying statistical concepts in designing experiments, 
understanding variability, and drawing meaningful inferences, participants will
be equipped with the knowledge and skills for data-driven decision-making.
Statistics involves collection, analysis, interpretation, and communication of
data. 

Experimental design aims to describe and explain variation in natural systems by
intervening to affect that variation directly. 

 For example, the Salk polio vaccine trials
collected data about variation in polio incidence after injecting hundreds of 
thousands of schoolchildren with vaccine or placebo (or by observing more than a
million unvaccinated children for polio incidence and comparing this incidence
to that of the treatment group). This controlled trial hypothesized that the
vaccine would reduce the incidence of polio in schoolchildren.

Naturalistic studies gather data with minimal intervention, 
In observational studies,
