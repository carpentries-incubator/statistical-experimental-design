Good experimental design generates information-rich data with a clear message. 
In both scientific research and industry, experimental design plays a critical 
role in obtaining reliable and meaningful results. Scientists can better 
understand their work when they carry out well-conceived, well-executed 
experiments and then extract, communicate, and act on information generated in 
those experiments. This course will prepare scientists to design rigorous 
experiments that generate high-value data and to extract and communicate its 
messages. By applying statistical concepts in designing experiments, 
understanding variability, and drawing meaningful inferences, participants will
be equipped with the knowledge and skills for data-driven decision-making.

Statistical experimental design and data analysis fundamentals provie the 
background needed to plan, execute, and analyze experiments effectively. Data 
visualization approaches aid to interpret and communicate findings. Case studies 
using standard experimental designs illuminate concepts and place these designs 
in a real-world context. After completing this course, participants will be able 
to develop rigorous experimental designs that produce high-quality data.
